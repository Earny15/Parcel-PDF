# PDF Extraction Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Identified and Fixed âœ…

The main issue was that **environment variables were not accessible in the browser**. In Next.js, client-side code needs environment variables to be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

## What I Fixed:

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
- **Before**: `CLAUDE_API_KEY=...` (not accessible in browser)  
- **After**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAUDE_API_KEY=...` (accessible in browser)

### 2. Enhanced Logging  
Added comprehensive logging throughout the process:
- Claude API key loading status
- File upload details (name, size, type)
- Base64 conversion progress
- API call status and responses
- Extraction results

### 3. File Validation
- Added proper file type validation for PDFs and images
- Enhanced error handling for rejected files
- Better feedback for unsupported file types

## How to Test Now:

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /path/to/parcel-ocr-system
pnpm dev
```
Server runs at: **http://localhost:3002**

### 2. Upload Your RIVIGO PDF
1. Click **"Upload POD"** button
2. Check the **API Status Indicator**:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **"Claude API Connected"** = Real OCR enabled
   - ðŸ”´ **"Claude API Failed"** = Using mock data
3. Upload your PDF file (name it `3001823710.pdf` for best results)
4. Click **"Process Files"**

### 3. Check Console Logs
Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for:

```
Claude API Key loaded: sk-ant-api0... âœ…
Testing Claude API connection...
API Key available: true âœ…
API test response status: 200 âœ…
Claude API connection test: SUCCESS âœ…

Files dropped/selected: [File object] âœ…
File: 3001823710.pdf, Size: XXXXX bytes, Type: application/pdf âœ…

Starting PDF extraction for file: 3001823710.pdf âœ…
Converting file to base64... âœ…
Base64 conversion completed, length: XXXXX âœ…
Making Claude API call... âœ…
Claude API response status: 200 success âœ…
Extracted text from Claude: {...extracted data...} âœ…
```

### 4. Expected Results
- File processing without errors
- Real data extraction from your PDF
- Parcel matching with ID `3001823710`  
- Updated parcel with all extracted fields

## If Still Not Working:

### Check 1: API Key Loading
Look for this in console:
```
Claude API Key loaded: sk-ant-api0... 
```
If you see `NOT FOUND`, the environment variable isn't loading.

### Check 2: API Connection
Look for:
```
Claude API connection test: SUCCESS
```
If it shows `FAILED`, there's an authentication issue.

### Check 3: File Upload
Look for:
```
Files dropped/selected: [File]
File: yourfile.pdf, Size: XXXXX bytes, Type: application/pdf
```
If missing, the file isn't being detected properly.

### Check 4: OCR Processing
Look for:
```
Starting PDF extraction for file: yourfile.pdf
Claude API response status: 200 success
Extracted text from Claude: {...}
```

## Common Issues:

### "API Key Not Found"
- Ensure `.env.local` contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAUDE_API_KEY=...`
- Restart development server after changing `.env.local`

### "File Not Accepted"  
- Ensure file is PDF or image format
- Check console for "Rejected files" messages

### "No Parcel Match"
- Ensure filename contains the LR/docket number
- Check that matching parcel exists in the system
- Review console logs for matching attempts

### "Mock Data Instead of Real OCR"
- API key authentication failed
- Check console for Claude API error messages
- Verify API key is valid and has credits

## Current Status: âœ… SHOULD BE WORKING

The PDF extraction should now work correctly with:
- âœ… Proper environment variable configuration  
- âœ… Claude API integration
- âœ… Detailed logging for debugging
- âœ… Enhanced file validation
- âœ… Real PDF data extraction
