# PDF Extraction and Parcel Matching - Fixed Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PDF Extraction Integration
- **Problem**: Claude PDF service was falling back to mock data due to missing API configuration
- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling, proper field normalization, and better mock data structure

### 2. Parcel Matching Algorithm  
- **Problem**: LR number extraction from filenames was limited and matching logic was basic
- **Fix**: Enhanced LR number extraction patterns and dual matching (filename + document content)

### 3. Data Mapping and Structure
- **Problem**: Field mapping between OCR output and parcel data was inconsistent
- **Fix**: Added data normalization layer and proper field mapping

### 4. Report Generation
- **Problem**: Reports didn't include extracted PDF data properly
- **Fix**: Enhanced comprehensive report with proper field sanitization

## Current Functionality

### PDF Processing Flow
1. **File Upload**: Users upload PDF/image files via "Upload POD" button
2. **OCR Processing**: Files processed using Claude API (or mock data if no API key)
3. **LR Number Extraction**: System extracts LR numbers from both filename and document content
4. **Parcel Matching**: Matches documents to existing parcels using multiple strategies
5. **Data Update**: Updates matched parcels with extracted POD information
6. **Report Generation**: Includes all extracted data in comprehensive reports

### LR Number Matching Strategies
The system now uses multiple approaches to match documents to parcels:

#### From Filename:
- `LR123456.pdf` → extracts "123456"
- `AWB_789012.pdf` → extracts "789012"  
- `DOCKET-345678.pdf` → extracts "345678"
- `123456789.pdf` → extracts "123456789"

#### From Document Content:
- Extracts docket/AWB numbers from OCR text
- Uses both filename and document LR numbers for matching

#### Matching Logic:
- Direct match: `parcel.lrNumber === extractedLR`
- Partial match: `parcel.lrNumber.includes(extractedLR)`
- Reverse match: `extractedLR.includes(parcel.lrNumber)`

### Mock Data vs Real OCR

#### Without Claude API Key:
- System uses realistic mock data
- Simulates all required fields (AWB, signature status, stamp status, etc.)
- Includes random damage comments and recipient details

#### With Claude API Key:
- Real PDF/image processing using Claude Vision API
- Extracts actual data from documents
- Comprehensive field extraction with intelligent parsing

## Setup Instructions

### For Testing (Mock Data):
1. No additional setup required
2. System automatically uses mock data
3. Upload any PDF/image files to test workflow

### For Production (Real OCR):
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your Claude API key: `CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Get API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
4. Restart development server

## Extracted Fields

The system now extracts and maps the following fields:

### Document Information:
- AWB/Docket Number
- Invoice Number
- E-way Bill Number

### Recipient Details:
- Receiver Name
- Receiver Address

### Package Information:
- Number of Boxes
- Actual Weight

### Verification Status:
- Signature Status (Present/Not Present/Not Clear)
- Stamp Status (Available/Not Available/Not Clear)

### Additional Data:
- Damage Comments
- Processing Metadata

## Console Logging

The system now includes comprehensive logging:
- File processing details
- LR number extraction results
- Matching attempts and results
- OCR extraction data
- Report generation statistics

Check browser console for detailed processing information.

## Testing the Workflow

1. **Create Test Parcels**: Use "Upload Parcels" with CSV template
2. **Upload POD Files**: Use "Upload POD" with PDF/image files
   - Name files with LR numbers (e.g., `22222222.pdf`)
3. **View Results**: Check console for matching results
4. **Check Details**: Click parcels to see extracted POD data
5. **Download Report**: Use "Download Report" to get comprehensive CSV

## Troubleshooting

### No Parcels Getting Updated:
- Check filename contains LR number that matches existing parcel
- Verify LR number extraction in console logs
- Ensure parcels exist with matching LR numbers/IDs

### Mock Data Instead of Real OCR:
- Verify Claude API key is set in `.env.local`
- Check console for "Claude API key not configured" warning
- Restart development server after adding API key

### Report Missing Data:
- Confirm parcels have `podProcessed: true` flag
- Check if extracted data was properly saved to parcel objects
- Verify report generation logs in console
